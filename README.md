# Portfolio Optimization with Markowitz Efficient Frontier (Excel VBA)

##  Project Overview
This project consists of an **Excel VBA application** designed to perform **portfolio optimization** based on the **Markowitz efficient frontier theory**.

The application allows users to import real financial market data, compute key statistical indicators, simulate portfolios, and visually analyze optimal investment strategies using modern portfolio theory.

This project combines **financial theory**, **quantitative analysis**, and **programming** within an interactive Excel environment.

##  Main Objectives
- Apply Markowitz portfolio theory in a practical setting
- Automate financial calculations using VBA
- Provide clear and interactive visualizations of portfolio risk and return
- Assist decision-making through quantitative portfolio analysis

---

##  Key Features
- Import of real stock market data (CSV files from Nasdaq)
- Calculation of:
  - Daily and annualized returns
  - Covariance and correlation matrices
- Simulation of multiple portfolios
- Visualization of:
  - Efficient Frontier
  - Capital Market Line (CML)
  - Security Market Line (SML)
- Identification of the optimal portfolio (maximum Sharpe ratio)
- Final portfolio composition displayed with charts and key indicators

---

##  Financial Concepts Implemented
- Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz, 1952)
- Risk–return optimization
- Diversification
- Sharpe ratio maximization
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- Efficient Frontier

---

##  Application Structure
The Excel application is organized into several functional pages:
- **Home**: parameter selection (risk-free rate, number of portfolios)
- **Data**: imported financial time series and price charts
- **Calculations**: returns, covariance and correlation matrices
- **Optimization**: portfolio simulation and efficient frontier
- **SML**: asset positioning relative to the Security Market Line
- **Optimized Portfolio**: final allocation and performance summary

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Excel**
- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**
- Financial market data (CSV)
- Advanced Excel charts and dashboards
